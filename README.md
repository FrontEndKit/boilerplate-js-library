# Title 
Main description

## Getting Started
Usually, all my public repos are published on [GitHub][github-repo]
and mirrored on [BitBucket][bitbucket-repo].

For developing purposes only I suggest to use [bower][bower-link]
which will locally install this library as component in your project.
Instead, if you want to customize and/or recompile the library, it's
possibile to fork the repo and clone it locally on your computer.

### Customization and Recompilation
Once installed, if you want to customize/compile and test the sources,
type in terminal:
```bash
npm install
```
and all the required development dependencies will be locally installed.

To obtain a list of all available commands, just type in terminal:
```bash
grunt -h
```

## Documentation
Brief description of library purposes

Further details can be found into the documentation (currently not
provided online), which can be generated with:
```bash
grunt documenting
```
or
```bash
grunt jsdoc
```
Once the documentation is ready, you can navigate with your browser to
`./doc/index.html`.

## Usage

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing
coding style.
Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your
code using [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt).
